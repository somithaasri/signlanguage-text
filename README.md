# Sign Language to Text Converter 

This project aims to **convert Indian Sign Language gestures into readable English text** using computer vision and machine learning. The system processes hand gestures via webcam input and provides real-time text output, enabling communication between deaf or mute individuals and non-sign language speakers.

## Features

- Real-time hand gesture detection using **MediaPipe**
- Keypoint extraction and classification using **TensorFlow**
- Conversion of static signs (like alphabets A-Z and common words) to text
- Trained ML model for recognizing multiple signs
- GUI/Console display for real-time output
- Numpy-based keypoint storage for faster processing and training
